# GitHub Copilot Instructions

> These instructions apply to GitHub Copilot in VS Code and Agent Mode.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: SHARED CONTEXT

**Always adhere to the core project standards defined in `AGENTS.md`.**

## 🧠 Context Strategy

1. **Read `AGENTS.md` first** to understand the project architecture and rules.
2. **Check `docs/context/`** for detailed feature specifications if relevant.
3. **Use Agent Personas:**
   - Act as `@security-agent` for security tasks.
   - Act as `@ui-agent` (or `@frontend-specialist`) for UI tasks.

## ⚡ Workflow Optimization

- **Prompt Queueing:** Submit sequential tasks if needed.
- **Issue Context:** When working on an issue, read the full issue history (#ID).
